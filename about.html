                <h1>Artisanal Vegan 'Naise Products by Dr Emmanuel Manilowe</h1>
                <p>
                    From a young age, Emmanuel "Manny" Manilowe has dedicated his life to the pursuit of healthy, cruelty-free living, following in the footsteps of generations of Manilowes before him.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Every morning of the year (with the exception of Cinco de Mayo) Manny personally opens up the 'naise production facility at his home. After brewing a strong cup of fair-trade organic coffee, and stirring in a hearty dollop of his own Vegan Mayonnaise, Manny stands and proudly surveys the condiment empire that he and his forefathers have forged in the flames of passion and competition, and tempered with a cool zest for life's simple pleasures. Starting in simpler times, the Manilowes have remarkably managed to sustain a rock-hard business model in the age of Big Mayo and a general decline in the appreciation of the Mayonnaiseur's craft. Manny's philosophy for running the business is no different to the beloved product he makes and the "Quick, Thick and Vegan" ethos underpins every decision.

                    Coffee in hand, Manny conducts a solitary tour of the production floor to inspect the facilities and ensure that the stringent Manilowe standards are being upheld each day. Manny greets each of his agrarian era 'naise churns like old friends, laying a gentle hand on their wooden bodies and thanking them for their service with a heartfelt "Naisemaste".

                <p>
                    Manny and his wife Linda pride themselves on the premium, artisanal, first-run vegan mayonnaise that bears his name. Delicious, thick, creamy and cruelty-free, Doctor Manilowe's Vegan Mayo has both sweet and savory applications, as well as dozens of other uses around the home as an environmentally-friendly, vegan and food-safe alternative to WD40.
